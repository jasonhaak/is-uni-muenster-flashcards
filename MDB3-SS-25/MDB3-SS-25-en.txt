"True or false:<br />
In a network with positive network effects, every equilibrium is socially optimal."	"False:<br>
An equilibrium may be individually stable without achieving maximum social welfare (e.g., when too few users join to realize full network utility)."
"True or false:  <br />
Network effects lead some users to be willing to pay more than they would without network effects."	True
"True or false:  <br />
Network effects lead consumers to make decisions independently of how many others use the product."	"False:  <br />
With network effects, perceived value (and thus purchase decision) strongly depends on how many others are expected to use the product."
"Question:  <br />
What does evolutionary game theory examine in comparison to classical game theory?"	Evolutionary game theory examines which strategies prevail or disappear over time in populations, based on their fitness or relative success, without assuming rational calculation by actors.
"True or false:  <br />
In evolutionary game theory, non-optimal behaviors can also prevail in the long run."	"True:  <br />
What matters is not optimal rationality, but relative reproduction rate or success stability within an environment or population."

"True or false:<br />
The Wright-Fisher model has no random sampling but deterministic generational inheritance."	"False:<br />
The Wright-Fisher model is stochastic. Each new generation arises through random sampling with replacement from the previous generation."

In the SIRS model, objects are immune after infection."	"False:<br />
This applies to the SIR model."
"True or false:<br />
In the SIRS model, objects are not immune after infection and can be reinfected."	"False:<br />
This applies to the SIS model."
"Question:  <br />
Why do epidemics often occur in waves?"	Because infection rates oscillate: after high infection phases, temporary immunity or behavioral change occurs, followed by renewed susceptibility (e.g., due to immunity loss or behavior change), leading to new waves.
"True or false:<br />
Oscillation of disease infections synchronizes across networks and borders."	True
"True or false:<br />

Contacts in a contact network are transient and exist only for a certain time."	True
"Question:<br />
What is the consequence of asymmetric information about thresholds in a network regarding collective action?"	Due to asymmetric information about thresholds—where a node only knows the thresholds of its neighbors—collective action is limited or not performed, even if possible.
"True or false:<br />
Central institutions can help generate knowledge and overcome threshold information asymmetries in a network."	True
"Question:<br />
How is the threshold \(p\) calculated at which a node switches to behavior \(a\)?"	\(p \geq \frac{b}{(a + b)}\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the payoffs for matching behavior.
"Question:<br />
How can pluralistic ignorance be overcome?"	By deliberately spreading information about actual expectations and willingness of others (e.g., through gatekeepers or transparent signals).
"Question:<br />
How can pluralistic ignorance prevent a cascade?"	By individuals wrongly believing that others are not willing to act. This leads to inaction, even when internal support exists.
"Example:<br />
Collective action"	"<ul>
<li>Protests</li>
</ul>"
"True or false:<br />
Collective action occurs only if enough participants are present."	True
"Question:<br />
Why is a cascade usually stopped and becomes incomplete?"	A cascade is usually stopped by clusters, local bridges, and homophily, turning it into an incomplete cascade. The threshold for adoption may also be a reason.
"Example:<br />
Incomplete cascade"	"<ul>
<li>Android and Apple</li>
<li>Civic initiatives</li>
</ul>"
"True or false:<br />
A testimonial from satisfied neighbors acts as a private signal and can prevent cascades."	"False:<br />
A testimonial is a public signal that builds trust and lowers the adoption threshold. It can promote, not prevent, cascades."

"True or false:  <br />
The long-tail strategy aims to make only the top products more successful."	"False:  <br />
It aims to make the large mass of niche products more visible and economically viable."

"True or false:<br />
In preferential attachment, new nodes benefit equally from existing node connections."	"False:<br />
New nodes prefer to connect to already well-connected nodes, leading to an unequal, scale-free network structure."
"True or false:<br />
Preferential attachment means new nodes randomly and evenly attach to existing nodes."	"False:<br />
Preferential attachment is not about equal distribution. New nodes connect with higher probability to highly connected nodes (the rich get richer)."
"Example:<br />
Power law"	"<ul>
<li>Music downloads</li>
<li>Phone calls to certain numbers</li>
</ul>"
"Question:  <br />

"Question:<br />
How do power laws arise?"	Power laws arise through preferential attachment and information cascades.
"True or false:<br />
Power-law distributions necessarily result from differences in quality."	"False:<br />
Power laws often result from visibility mechanisms like preferential attachment and don't necessarily reflect quality."
"True or false:<br />
In a network with low and high equilibrium levels, a bottleneck can occur that blocks growth and prevents reaching the high equilibrium."	True
"True or false:<br />
In a network with network effects below the tipping point, utility comes from individual preferences as well as from user base growth."	True
"Example:<br />
Competition in markets with network effects"	"<ul>
<li>VHS and Betamax</li>
</ul>"
"Question:<br />
What does it mean if a product has two tipping points, and what are the implications for market strategies?"	Between the lower and upper tipping point is an unstable zone: few users lead to decline, many to growth. Strategies must aim to cross the critical threshold quickly, e.g., through subsidies or influencer marketing.
"Question:  <br />
What is a tipping point in the context of network effects?"	A critical user threshold where a small increase leads to rapid adoption growth or a small drop leads to decline.
"True or false:<br />
The stronger the network effects, the higher the tipping point."	"False:<br />
Stronger network effects may mean fewer users are needed to trigger self-reinforcing adoption. The tipping point may be lower."
"True or false:  <br />
Tipping points arise only from negative network effects."	"False:  <br />
They arise from positive network effects with critical thresholds. Behavior becomes unstable when certain usage levels are crossed."
"Question:<br />
What is a self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium in network effects?"	A state where the user count is high enough that each new user gains added value. Demand stabilizes via positive feedback and persists despite small fluctuations.
"Question:  <br />
What is the risk of assuming self-fulfilling expectations in the market?"	If expectations are too high and unmet, adoption may collapse.
"Question:  <br />
What is a self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium in the context of network effects?"	An equilibrium formed when users expect a certain user count, and this expectation shapes behavior such that the expected count is actually reached.
"Question:<br />
What role does asymmetric information about network size play in the formation of self-fulfilling expectations equilibria?"	Asymmetric information causes actors to base decisions on perceived—not actual—network size. If many share the same (false) expectation, it can still lead to an actual equilibrium.
"True or false:<br />
A self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium can be unstable if users lack confidence in the expected demand."	True
"True or false:<br />
A self-fulfilling expectations equilibrium can only form if consumers trust the prediction."	True
"True or false:<br />
The equilibrium quantity lies at the social optimum as it maximizes welfare."	True
"Question:  <br />
How is the equilibrium price and quantity determined in a market without network effects?"	Through the interaction of consumers' reservation prices and producers' marginal costs—specifically where supply meets demand.
"True or false:  <br />
In price finding in a market without network effects, consumers consider the decisions of others."	"False:  <br />
Each consumer decides independently based on self-interest, not on others’ choices."
"True or false:<br />
The direct-benefit effect requires neighboring nodes in a graph to enable a network effect."	True
"True or false:<br />
A direct-benefit effect only occurs when more than two neighbors adopt the same innovation."	"False:<br />
Even two connected nodes can create a direct benefit through shared usage."
"Example:<br />
Information cascade"	"<ul>
<li>Fashion and style trends</li>
<li>People prefer eating at full restaurants over empty ones</li>
</ul>"
"Question:<br />
Why is an information cascade likely to break down with new information?"	Because cascades are based on limited, aggregated information, and even small counterexamples can disrupt the imitation effect.
"Question:  <br />
Why can an information cascade occur even without positive evaluation of a product?"	Because people often see only observed adoptions (e.g., influencers) and do not evaluate actual quality. A product can spread via social imitation even if it's bad.
"Question:<br />
What role do opinion leaders (influencers) play in overcoming the tipping point in networks?"	They can create early visibility through their reach and initiate adoption, leading to a sufficient number of early adopters that trigger self-reinforcing diffusion.
"True or false:<br />
Information cascades rely on extensive information processing and are stable against new information."	"False:<br />
Information cascades often rely on very little information and are fragile. New or contradictory information can easily interrupt them."
"True or false:<br />
Information cascades can also occur when all actors behave fully rationally."	True
"True or false:<br />
Information cascades are sensitive to new or contradictory information."	True
"True or false:<br />
Professional images on recipe platforms increase the risk of an information cascade."	"False:<br />
Images improve the quality of private signals and make decisions more independent of public perception. They stabilize against cascades."
"Question:  <br />
Why can only the outer nodes maintain state \(0\) in a graph with an odd number of nodes to achieve a stable state?"	Because with symmetric distribution of influences, equilibrium is only possible if the outer nodes do not attempt to change their state. Their contribution to the overall system is thus minimal or neutral.
"True or false:  <br />
If a graph has an odd number of nodes, a stable state is only possible if the outer nodes adopt state 0."	True
"Question:<br />
How can it be empirically explained that fair offers are often made in the ultimatum game, even though minimal offers would be rational?"	Besides monetary payoffs, fairness perceptions, social norms, and reputation also influence behavior. Players reject unfair offers on principle, affecting the strategy of the proposer.
"True or false:<br />
The outcome of an ultimatum game tends toward fair distribution, influenced by perceptions of fairness and culture."	True
"True or false:<br />

"True or false:<br />
In a monopoly, traders act as gatekeepers."	True
"Example:<br />
Traders in perfect competition"	"<ul>
<li>Development of goods from China that are delivered directly to consumers</li>
</ul>"
"Question:<br />
Why do traders in a perfectly competitive network not make a profit?"	Because competing traders undercut each other to win business. As buyers and sellers have alternative connections to other traders, intermediary profits are driven to \(0\).
"True or false:<br />
Markets with perfect competition have only a small number of traders."	True
"True or false:<br />
If all buyers and sellers have the same reservation prices, traders earn no profit under competition."	True
"True or false:<br />
A trader can earn payoffs without fulfilling a functional role in the network."	"False:<br />
Traders must serve an intermediary role to generate utility and receive payoffs."
"True or false:<br />
A trader must provide a function in a network to earn a payoff. This is achieved by increasing social utility, which would decrease if a particular edge between the trader and a buyer or seller were removed."	True
"True or false:<br />
Traders provide access between buyers and sellers who would otherwise not be connected."	True
"Example:<br />
Evolutionary Arms Race"	"<ul>
<li>Taller trees get more light than shorter ones but must invest energy in growth</li>
</ul>"
"True or false:  <br />
In evolutionary game theory, players actively choose their strategy to achieve the highest payoff."	"False:  <br />
Strategies are often predetermined, e.g., by biology or social roles. Selection happens via reproduction, not choice."
"Question:<br />
When is a strategy considered evolutionarily stable even if it is not Pareto-efficient?"	When it can resist rare mutations (deviating strategies) because its expected fitness remains higher, even if alternative strategies might lead to higher total welfare collectively.
"True or false:<br />
When invading with an alternative strategy, that strategy has lower fitness than the evolutionarily stable one."	True
"True or false:  <br />
An evolutionarily stable strategy can be displaced by migrants or innovators introducing a new strategy."	"False:  <br />
Only if the new strategy consistently outperforms the established one in fitness will it prevail; otherwise, the evolutionarily stable strategy remains dominant."
"Example:<br />
Mixed Strategy"	"<ul>
<li>Sports for deciding strategies</li>
</ul>"
"Example:<br />
Hawk-Dove Game"	"<ul>
<li>Behavior of states acting aggressively or passively</li>
</ul>"
"True or false:<br />
In the Hawk-Dove game, aggressive behavior always leads to evolutionarily stable strategies."	"False:<br />
Two aggressive players (Hawk-Hawk) receive low payoffs. Evolutionary stability requires mixed strategies or asymmetric role distributions."
"True or false:<br />
The Hawk-Dove game has no evolutionarily stable strategy."	True
"Question:  <br />
What does the stag hunt game metaphor illustrate in evolutionary game theory?"	It shows that survival of a cooperative strategy (e.g., stag hunting) depends on whether it can compete with less risky but individually executable strategies (e.g., rabbit hunting), depending on frequency and behavior of others in the population.
"Question:<br />
How can one identify a coordination game in social contexts like protests or political demonstrations?"	"<ul>
<li>At least two equilibria exist<ul>
<li>Participation (high social benefit)</li>
<li>Non-participation (low but low-risk benefit)</li></ul></li>
<li>Mutual dependency of decisions</li>
<li>Individual benefit increases if others also participate</li>
</ul>"
"True or false:<br />
A coordination game typically has only one Nash equilibrium."	"False:<br />

"Question:<br />
How does the Schelling model work?"	In the Schelling model, two types of agents with different characteristics live in a 2D grid and have neighbors horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. A neighbor is satisfied if a certain number of surrounding agents are of the same type. If dissatisfied, the agent moves to a free cell where they are more content. This can affect others' satisfaction, triggering a dynamic chain reaction.
"True or false:<br />
In the Schelling model, the two agent types tend to sort into two large spatially segregated groups over several iterations."	True
"Question:<br />

"Question:<br />
How does embeddedness affect the maintenance of edges?"	The more common neighbors two nodes share, the higher the embeddedness and the more stable their connection tends to be.

What does Bayes' theorem describe in the context of rational actors making a decision?"	Rational actors update their beliefs about the quality of a decision based on observed signals, applying Bayes' theorem to calculate a new probability of choosing the option.
"Example:<br />
Externality"	"<ul>
<li>Inventions: positive externality</li>
<li>Vaccinations: positive externality</li>

"True or false:<br />
The Nash equilibrium always guarantees the welfare-maximizing solution."	"False:<br />
A Nash equilibrium is stable under rational behavior but not necessarily efficient or welfare-maximizing."
"True or false:<br />
Every Nash equilibrium is also evolutionarily stable."	"False:<br />
Only some Nash equilibria are evolutionarily stable, depending on payoff conditions."

Various types of graphs"	
Graphs appear in many areas where it is important to show {{c1::how things are physically or logically connected in a network structure}}.	
"{{c1::A network equilibrium}} is {{c2::a market equilibrium}} where {{c2::in a market}} with {{c2::network externalities}}, a {{c2::stable state}} is reached.<br />

"<p>The network equilibrium arises from:</p>
<ul>
<li>{{c1::no buyers and no supply}}</li>
<li>{{c2::a small number of buyers with an unstable equilibrium}}</li>
<li>{{c3::a large number of buyers with a stable equilibrium}}</li>
</ul>"	
{{c1::Human capital}} is {{c2::a production factor}} in the form of {{c2::skills and knowledge of the workforce}}.	
{{c1::A Pareto optimum}} is {{c2::a state}} in which {{c2::no further Pareto improvement is possible}}.	
{{c1::A Pareto improvement}} is {{c2::a measure}} for {{c2::achieving Pareto efficiency}}.	
{{c1::Pareto efficiency}} is {{c2::a state in which no alternative allocation makes one party better off without making another worse off}}.	
{{c1::The dominant strategy}} is {{c2::the best strategy and best response for a party}}, regardless of {{c2::the strategies of other parties}}.	
{{c1::The internalization of externalities}} is {{c2::the creation of positive or negative incentives}} for {{c2::optimizing market equilibrium in the presence of negative externalities}}.	
"{{c1::An externality}} is {{c2::a cost or benefit}} of {{c2::one party's decision}}, which {{c2::affects the welfare}} of {{c2::uninvolved third parties}}.<br />
{{c1::{{c2::<img src=""2021-Bild-Sieg-Wohlfahrtsverlust.png"" alt=""""><br />

"{{c1::Externalities}} can {{c2::lead to market failure}} if the costs generated by the {{c1::externality}} are {{c3::not borne by the seller}}, resulting in a welfare loss.<br />
{{c1::{{c2::{{c3::<img src=""2021-Bild-Sieg-Wohlfahrtsverlust.png"" alt=""""><br />

An externality can be positive or negative. Positive externalities lead to {{c1::self-fulfilling expectations}}, while negative externalities lead to {{c1::self-defeating expectations}}.	
"{{c1::A network externality}} is {{c2::an externality}} caused by {{c2::a positive external network effect}}, which exists when {{c3::the value of a good increases with the number of users}}.<br />

{{c1::The Nash equilibrium}} is {{c2::a strategy}} in which {{c2::interconnected parties have chosen their best possible strategy in response to the strategies of others}}.	
{{c1::Perfect competition}} is {{c2::a market structure}} and {{c2::a special type of polypoly}} in which {{c3::identical homogeneous goods}} are offered, resulting in {{c3::minimized price differences}}.	
{{c1::A monopoly}} is {{c2::a market structure}} with {{c2::high demand}} and {{c2::a single supplier}}, which gives {{c3::the supplier high market power}} and {{c4::the ability to set prices}}.	
{{c1::The prisoner's dilemma}} is {{c2::a game theory cooperation problem}}, where {{c2::self-interested behavior leads to worse outcomes for all parties than cooperation, and cooperative behavior by others can improve one’s outcome}}.	
"{{c1::Conditional probability}} is the probability \(Pr[A|B]\) that {{c2::an event occurs given that another event has already occurred}}:<br>
\(Pr[A \mid B] = \frac{Pr[A \cap B]}{Pr[B]}\)"
