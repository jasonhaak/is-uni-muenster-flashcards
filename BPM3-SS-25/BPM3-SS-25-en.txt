"Question:<br />
Which cross-phase accompanies all Architecture Development Method phases continuously?"	Requirements Management: This phase ensures that all requirements from the stakeholders' perspective are consistently tracked, evaluated, and adapted across all phases if necessary.
"Question:<br />
What role does Requirements Management play as a cross-cutting process in the Architecture Development Method, and why is it essential for consistency in EAM?"	Requirements Management ensures that stakeholder requirements are consistently captured, managed, and verified across all phases. It links goals, architectural principles, design decisions, and implementations, thereby ensuring coherence in architecture development throughout the lifecycle.
"Question:<br />
What does Phase H: Architecture Change Management include?"	This phase ensures the ongoing development and adaptation of the architecture during operation. It identifies necessary changes, assesses their relevance, and initiates a new ADM cycle if needed. The goal is a living architectural lifecycle.
"Question:<br />
What tasks does Architecture Change Management fulfill in the ADM?"	This phase ensures that changes in the organization are checked for architectural impact. It decides whether a new ADM cycle is needed and establishes a controlled approach to managing architecture changes in operation.
"Question:<br />
What is the task of Phase G: Implementation Governance?"	This phase oversees the implementation of the architecture. It ensures quality, compliance with architectural requirements, and allows corrective actions in case of deviations.
"Question:<br />
What is the goal of Phase F: Migration Planning?"	Based on the architecture roadmap, a concrete migration plan is developed. Projects, dependencies, resources, timelines, and responsibilities are defined and prioritized.
"Question:<br />
What happens in Phase E: Opportunities &amp; Solutions?"	This phase identifies implementation options, consolidates architecture building blocks from previous phases, and develops an architecture roadmap and transition architectures.
"Question:<br />
